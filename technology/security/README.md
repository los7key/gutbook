# Security

Back in August of 2020 I got my OSCP certification.  I got it mostly for fun as cyber security has always been a passion of mine.  In fact, I had big dreams of one day doing it for a living.  But first let’s go back..

The year was 1998, I was in the US Navy and was living in San Diego, CA.  My friend, who was also in the Navy (and later went to Captian’s Mast for obtaining his Commanding Officer’s email password), got me hooked.  We spent every chance we had to geek out.  Whether it was learning Linux, looking for hardware for “the next big thing", or attending 2600 meetings and DEFCON. See rabbit hole on the history of the internet

Fast forward to when security was just becoming a thing.  There were exactly two other people in the large company I worked for that were responsible for security.  One of whom I knew fairly well. He often explained how security was “boring” and what his day-to-day work was like.  That guy is a CISO somewhere now.  

Despite what I knew and coming from another company where I was almost solely responsible for their security, I feel like this was pivotal to my moving away from the unknown(?) InfoSec path to the more comfortable path of making a sysadmin my career, especially at a time of having a family to support.

About 15 years later, my teenage son and his friends were taking high school and college-level computer science classes and I got the bug again. Not only that, but the wealth of information and tools had come a LONG way in the last 15 years haha

This pretty much sums up my security background.
