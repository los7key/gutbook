# How my site works

My site is built with a combination of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and [GitHub Pages](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/) along with some other bits of code Iâ€™ve found around the interwebs.  I recently upgraded the theme and it stomped on a bunch of my configurations.  I didn't think to put it in git and my notes are terrible.&#x20;

Here are some links and resources (and other tips) to remember how this all works next time I wait 2 years between blog posts.

### Basic Ingredients

#### **Jekyll Tips**

* Start local server on localhost, port 4000

```
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

* Start local server on 0.0.0.0 so other hosts can connect/test

```
bundle exec jekyll serve --host=0.0.0.0
```
