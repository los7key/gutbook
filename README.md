# Welcome

Apparently.. it's a digital garden. &#x20;

I've had ideas for a blog and website for a long time but never did much about it because I felt like I couldn't find the bits of technology that would compromise the site I envisioned.  My problem was that I had never heard of "digital gardening" and I wanted so many things in my site.  I wanted a blog, a wiki, and a little eye candy but none of the technologies I knew could do it.  After various failed attempts with quite a few options, it occurred to me that the answer might not be a single technology, but a "network" of technologies within a single domain. &#x20;

While looking for some technical information I stumbled across [Nikita Voloboev's](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz) site and I realized this is \*exactly\* what I wanted!  The more I poked around the more excited I got about the technology that built it.  I was already well on my way with my [site](technology/web/how-my-site-works.md) running on  [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and [GitHub Pages](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/) but I just couldn't figure out how to get the notes aspect incorporated.  Ironically, I did give gitbooks a try previously, but didn't actually consider using them together, rather than one or the other.
