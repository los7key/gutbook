# Venom OG

## About

Venom OG is an indica-leaning strain with a high that’s as potent -- but not nearly as menacing -- as its name. Created by Rare Dankness, the prolific breeders who have also developed [Ghost Train Haze](https://www.wikileaf.com/strain/ghost-train-haze/), Venom OG is a cross between their proprietary [Rare Darkness #1](https://www.wikileaf.com/strain/rare-darkness/) and [Poison OG](https://www.wikileaf.com/strain/og-poison/). The strain offers mostly relaxing sedative effects that are therapeutic enough to soothe pain and anxiety yet stimulating enough to enjoy recreationally. Venom OG’s psychoactivity has been measured at between 11% and a whopping 27%.
